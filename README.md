This assignment involves working with various data sources, including text files, CSV files, and URLs. Data is processed and extracted with the help of different libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, BeautifulSoup, and Requests.

**Question 1**

This program process text from a local file to identify the top 10 most frequent words.

**Question 2**

This program performs text processing to generate bigrams and getting the five most frequently occuring pair of words.

This program identifies nearly similar lines of text by cleaning the text of whitespace and symbols. It then displays the total number of duplicate sets and lists the first two examples found.

**Question 4**

This program filters student data using Pandas and saves it to a CSV file. It then displays the total number of student and their average grade.

**Question 5**

This program creates a new categorical variable from the grades of the student. It then generates a summary table for each band.

**Question 6**

This program creates a new categorical variable named "risk" based on the violent crimes data per area. It then groups the data by these risk levels to calculate and display the average unemployment percentage for each group.

**Question 10**

This program defines a reusable function that searches for a specific keyword within a text file and then displays a list of all matching lines along with their corresponding line numbers.
